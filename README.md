The purpose of this project was to build a simple distributed application. The travel application sets up a client that communicates with multiple servers to book a trip.

The Application folder has code designed to run with one client and three servers (Airline, CarRental, and Hotel). 

The Add_DB_Layer folder is designed to run with one client and two servers (Airline and MongoDB). This code requires you to install and run MongoDB on your MongoDB Server.
