The code is designed to run on four machines/virtual machines and communicate via RPC. If you are not familiar with virtual machines, look into using VirtualBox or AWS to run the application. If you don't want to use virtual machine you can run all of the code on one machine and communicate to servers running on the localhost through different ports.

 **Note that you will have to updated the IP address and port numbers appropriately where noted in the code**
