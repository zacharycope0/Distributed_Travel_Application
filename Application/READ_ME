  The purpose of this project was to build a simple distributed application. The travel application sets up a client that communicates
  will three seperate servers to book a trip.
  
  The code is designed to run on four machines/virtual machines and communicate via RPC. If you are not familiar with virtual machines,
  look into using VirtualBox or AWS to run the application.

 #Note that you will have to updated the IP address and port numbers appropriately where noted in the code.
